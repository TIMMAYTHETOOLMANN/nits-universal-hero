**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with progressive disclosure for complex data

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Custom cyberpunk palette with functional color coding
**Primary Color**: Neon green (oklch(0.75 0.25 145)) - represents AI activity and success states
**Secondary Colors**: Electric purple (oklch(0.65 0.3 300)) - accent for autonomous features
**Accent Color**: Cyber blue (oklch(0.1 0.02 240)) - background depth and card surfaces
**Risk Color Coding**: 
- Low risk: Green (oklch(0.75 0.25 145))
- Medium risk: Orange (oklch(0.7 0.15 60))
- High risk: Red (oklch(0.6 0.25 25))
- Critical risk: Purple (oklch(0.65 0.3 300))

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Monospace primary (Courier Prime) for technical authenticity
**Primary Font**: Courier Prime - maintains forensic/technical aesthetic
**Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, body text, and code/data output
**Readability Focus**: High contrast ratios for extended analysis sessions

### Component Selection & Customization
**Primary Components**: Cards for data organization, Collapsible sections for detailed results
**Interactive Elements**: Enhanced buttons with hover effects, Progress bars with gradient fills
**Form Elements**: Custom styling for upload zones with drag-drop feedback
**Status Indicators**: Real-time metrics, AI confidence displays, training progress

### Animations & Interactions
**Purposeful Motion**: 
- Upload zone scaling and glow effects on drag-over
- Progress bars with gradient animations during analysis
- Smooth transitions between tabs and collapsible sections
- Hover effects on interactive elements

## Implementation Considerations
