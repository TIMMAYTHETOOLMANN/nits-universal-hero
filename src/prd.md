## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Users should feel they have access to cutting-edge forensic technology that provides professional-grade analysis capabilities.

**Design Personality**: Cyberpunk-inspired forensic aesthetic that conveys advanced AI capabilities while maintaining professional credibility.

**Visual Metaphors**: Matrix-style interfaces, forensic laboratory aesthetics, advanced AI system indicators.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface that reveals complexity progressively - simple for basic use, powerful for expert analysis.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Custom cyberpunk palette with functional color coding

**Primary Colors**:
- **Neon Green (oklch(0.75 0.25 145))**: Success states, active patterns, AI confidence indicators
- **Electric Purple (oklch(0.65 0.3 300))**: Accent color for AI features and advanced functionality
- **Cyber Blue (oklch(0.1 0.02 240))**: Card backgrounds and structural elements

**Secondary Colors**:
- **Warning Orange (oklch(0.7 0.15 60))**: Medium risk indicators and caution states
- **Critical Red (oklch(0.6 0.25 25))**: High risk findings and destructive actions

**Color Psychology**: The cyberpunk palette communicates advanced technology and precision while maintaining professional credibility for forensic work.

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background (oklch(0.05 0 0)) with Foreground (oklch(0.9 0.05 145)) - WCAG AAA compliant
- Card (oklch(0.1 0.02 240)) with Card-foreground (oklch(0.95 0 0)) - WCAG AAA compliant
- Primary (oklch(0.75 0.25 145)) with Primary-foreground (oklch(0.05 0 0)) - WCAG AAA compliant

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Monospace family (Courier Prime) throughout for technical, forensic aesthetic

**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headers: Bold weights with increased letter spacing
- Body text: Regular weight with generous line height (1.5x)
- Code/data: Monospace with syntax highlighting through color

**Typography Consistency**: Single font family maintains cohesive technical aesthetic while size and weight create clear hierarchy.

**Selected Fonts**: Courier Prime from Google Fonts - provides professional monospace appearance with good readability.

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Tab-based navigation guides users through analysis workflow, with primary actions highlighted in brand colors.

**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates breathing room around complex technical information.

**Grid System**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout that adapts to content complexity.

**Content Density**: Balanced approach - detailed information available when needed, clean overview by default.

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions reinforce state changes and loading processes without distracting from analysis work.

**Hierarchy of Movement**: Progress indicators and state transitions animated, static content remains stable.

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: Shadcn v4 components with cyberpunk customization:
- Cards for content organization
- Tabs for workflow navigation  
- Collapsible sections for progressive disclosure
- Badges for status and categorization
- Dialogs for pattern creation workflow

**Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive grid layout with stacked columns on smaller screens, preserved functionality across devices.

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
**Potential Obstacles**: 
- Complex pattern creation might overwhelm new users
- Large document analysis could cause performance issues
- AI analysis failures need graceful degradation

**Edge Case Handling**: 
- Progressive disclosure of advanced pattern features
- File size limits and progress indicators
- Fallback to traditional pattern matching when AI unavailable

## Implementation Considerations
**Scalability Needs**: Persistent storage for custom patterns, performance optimization for large document sets

**Testing Focus**: Pattern accuracy validation, AI integration reliability, export format integrity

**Critical Questions**: How do we balance AI sophistication with user control? How do we validate custom pattern effectiveness?
