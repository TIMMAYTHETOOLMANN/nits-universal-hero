Subject: Tax Evasion Strategy
Date: January 15, 2024

We have successfully hidden $2,500,000 in unreported income through our offshore account in the Cayman Islands. 

The shell company we established has helped us avoid paying $875,000 in federal taxes. Our accounting firm has prepared false returns that understate our revenue by $1,200,000.

Wire transfers totaling $9,900 were made to avoid reporting requirements.

Total saved through tax fraud: $3,575,000`
